				<h2>About Confectionarium</h2>

				<p>Confectionarium is an online community for bakers and sweet-makers, both professional and enthusiast. It is a member-based platform where users can share recipes and techniques, show off creations, and seek advice. Their image is inviting, social, and delicious.</p>

				<h2>Our Design System</h2>

				<p>The driving factors are to make the site's building blocks purposeful, consistent, reliable, and clear. The system is named Recipe because it serves as the guide for employees and company partners. Similar to how recipes tell you how to construct a dish, Recipe directs the "ingredients" - components, icons, colors, ect. and the "instructions"- policies, branding, font family, etc. and directs you on how to expertly combine them into a successful project that accurately represents your company.</p>

				<p>Recipe takes a very thorough approach to the system, opting to explain the why in addition to the what and the how. There are in-depth sections on color, typography, user experience design, and content.</p>

				<p>Overall, the guide does a great job of communicating the way Confectionarium believes products should be built. It’s practical, presented well, and provides logic that supports each choice.</p>

				<h2>Our Style Expression</h2>

				<h3>Inviting</h3>

				<p>We want Confectionarium's community to be inviting to all sweet and treat enthusiasts where we can share, encourage, and inspire each other. Even if you're new to the kitchen and don't know a melon ball from wrecking ball, this is the place for you! And for those with some experience under their apron, you can share tips and tricks for creating the ultimate treats that would give Martha Stewart a run for her money.</p>

				<h3>Social</h3>
				
				<p>Keep in constant contact and up to date with the latest recipe posts from our members. Subscribe to our blog where we uncover seasonal recipes perfect for your holiday celebrations. Vote for your most liked recipes, give feedback, and ask questions about all your confection creations.</p>

				<h3>Delicious</h3>

				<p>What can you post here? If it's full of sugar and fat, chances are it belongs here. We love seeing confections including chocolates, toffees, candies, and baked goods like cakes, cookies, pies and breads. Topics of discussion are solely about confections. See what other confectioners have dished out and show off your sweet creations.</p>
